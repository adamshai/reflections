Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want others to clone my code and/or to collaborate with other developers

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: If I collaborate on GitHub another developer may change the same lines that I change in my local repository. So automatic sync will modify my functionality or results in merge conflicts and I don't want that
